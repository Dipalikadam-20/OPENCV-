# OPENCV-
This Repository contains simple implementation to learn the basics of OpenCV 

1. Loading and Displaying the image
   load_image_opencv.py:
    The load_image_opencv.py script shows simple implementation of loading the image in OpenCV,
    displaying the image and saving the image back to the disk with different filetype.
    We also convert the color image to gray image and also display the spatial dimensions of the image.
    When dealing with images, we generally represent the dimensions in the order 
   (height,  width, channels)
    height represents number of rows of the image
    width represents the number of columns of the image
    channels represents the number of channels of the image. generally 3 channels i.e RGB for colored images
